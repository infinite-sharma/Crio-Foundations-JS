1) Escape Sequence:
There are some characters which need extra care while using them as part of string for example " or \ etc.
for using them in our string we need to use "\" (escape sequence) as prefix to them.

Some other escape sequences -
\' = single quote
\" = double quote
\\ = backslash
\n = newline (or line feed)
\r = carriage return 
\t = tab

2) String and String Methods:
string.length : It will provide the length of String. In java script length is not a function but a property.

3) Swith case:
switch(variable){
case <value1>:
case <value2>:
.
.
default:

Note: the value will be compare with "===" strict equality. Once the condition match all the expression will be executed till break found.

3) Function:
- In java script we don't need to define return types for the function like void, int etc.
